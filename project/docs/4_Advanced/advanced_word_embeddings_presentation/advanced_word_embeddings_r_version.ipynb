        "## What are Word Embeddings?\n",
        "\n",
        "Building off of the definition above, word embeddings are one way that humans can represent language in a way that is legible to a machine. More specifically, they are an NLP approach that use vectors to store textual data in multiple dimensions; by existing in the multi-dimensional space of vectors, word embeddings are able to include important semantic information within a given numeric representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if we are trying to answer a research question about how popular a term is on the web at a given time, we might use a simple word frequency analysis to count how many times the word \"candidate\" shows up in tweets during a defined electoral period. However, if we wanted to gain a more nuanced understanding of what kind of language, biases or attitudes contextualize the term, \"candidate\" in discourse, we would need to use a method like word embedding to encode meaning into our understanding of how people have talked about candidates over time. Instead of describing our text as a series of word counts, we would treat our text like coordinates in space, where similar words and concepts are closer to each other, and words that are different from each other are further away.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Comparing word frequency count and word embedding methods](media/word_frequency_vs_word_embeddings.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in the visualization above, a word frequency count returns the number of times the word \"candidate\" or \"candidates\" is used in a sample text corpus. When a word embedding is made from the same text corpus, we are able to map related concepts and phrases that are closely related to \"candidate\" as neighbours, while other words and phrases such as \"experimental study\" (which refers to the research paper in question, and not to candidates specifically) are further away. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here is another example of how different, but related words might be represented in a word embedding:\n",
        "<img src = \"media/w2v-Analogies.png\">\n",
        "\n",
        "## Making a Word Embedding\n",
        "So, how do word embeddings work? To make a word embedding, an input word gets compressed into a dense vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Creating a word embedding vector](media/creating_a_word_embedding.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The magic and mystery of the word embedding process is that often the vectors produced during the model embed qualities of a word or phrase that are not interpretable by humans. However, for our purposes, having the text in vector format is all we need. With this format, we can perform tests like cosine similarity and other kinds of operations. Such operations can reveal many different kinds of relationships between words, as we'll examine a bit later.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using word2vec\n",
        "\n",
        "Word2vec is one NLP technique that is commonly used to generate word embeddings. More precisely, word2vec is an algorithmic learning tool rather than a specific neural net that is already trained. The example we will be working through today has been made using this tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "The series of algorithms inside of the word2vec model try to describe and acquire parameters for a given word in terms of the text that appear immediately to the right and left in actual sentences. Essentially, it learns how to predict text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without going too deep into the algorithm, suffice it to say that it involves a two-step process: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. First, the input word gets compressed into a dense vector, as seen in the simplified diagram, \"Creating a Word Embedding,\" above. \n",
        "2. Second, the vector gets decoded into the set of context words. Keywords that appear within similar contexts will have similar vector representations in between steps. \n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine that each word in a novel has its meaning determined by the ones that surround it in a limited window. For example, in Moby Dick's first sentence, “me” is paired on either side by “Call” and “Ishmael.” After observing the windows around every word in the novel (or many novels), the computer will notice a pattern in which “me” falls between similar pairs of words to “her,” “him,” or “them.” Of course, the computer had gone through a similar process over the words “Call” and “Ishmael,” for which “me” is reciprocally part of their contexts. This chaining of signifiers to one another mirrors some of humanists' most sophisticated interpretative frameworks of language.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two main model architectures of word2vec are **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** and **Skip-Gram**, which can be distinguished partly by their input and output during training. \n",
        "\n",
        "**CBOW** takes the context words (for example, \"Call\",\"Ishmael\") as a single input and tries to predict the word of interest (\"me\").\n",
        "\n",
        "<div>\n",
        "<img src=\"media/CBOW.gif\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Skip-Gram** does the opposite, taking a word of interest as its input (for example, \"me\") and tries to learn how to predict its context words (\"Call\",\"Ishmael\"). \n",
        "\n",
        "<div>\n",
        "<img src=\"media/SG.gif\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, CBOW is is faster and does well with frequent words, while Skip-Gram potentially represents rare words better.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the word embedding is a vector, we are able perform tests like cosine similarity (which we'll learn more about in a bit!) and other kinds of operations. Those operations can reveal many different kinds of relationships between words, as we shall see.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Bias and Language Models\n",
        "\n",
        "You might already be piecing together that the encoding of meaning in word embeddings is entirely shaped by patterns of language use captured in the training data. That is, what is included in a word embedding directly reflects the complex social and cultural biases of everyday human language - in fact, exploring how these biases function and change over time (as we will do later) is one of the most interesting ways to use word embeddings in social research.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### It is simply impossible to have a bias-free language model (LM). \n",
        "\n",
        "In LMs, bias is not a bug or a glitch, rather, it is an essential feature that is baked into the fundamental structure. For example, LMs are not outside of learning and absorbing the pejorative dimensions of language which in turn, can result in reproducing harmful correlations of meaning for words about race, class or gender (among others). When unchecked, these harms can be “amplified in downstream applications of word embeddings” ([Arseniev-Koehler & Foster, 2020, p. 1](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8kud/)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like any other computational model, it is important to critically engage with the source and context of the training data. One way that [Schiffers, Kern and Hienert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06174v1) suggest doing this is by using domain specific models (2023). Working with models that understand the nuances of your particular topic or field can better account for \"specialized vocabulary and semantic relationships\" that can help make applications of WE more effective. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Preparing for our Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Word2vec Features\n",
        "\n",

        "* `alpha`: Learning rate (initial); prevents model from over-correcting, enables finer tuning</li>\n",

        "\n",
        "**Some limitations of the word2vec Model**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Within word2vec, common articles or conjunctions, called **stop words** such as \"the\" and \"and,\" may not provide very rich contextual information for a given word, and may need additional subsampling or to be combined into a word phrase (Anwla, 2019).\n",

Cosine Similarity thus helps us understand how much content overlap a set of documents have with one another. For example, imagine that we were to draw an arrow from the origin of the graph - point (0,0) - to the dot representing each text. This arrow is called a _vector_. \n",

        "Throughout this notebook we have seen how a number of mathematical operations can be used to explore word2vec's word embeddings. Hopefully this notebook has allowed you to see how the inherent biases of language become coded into word embeddings and systems that use word embeddings cannot be treated as search engines. \n",
        "\n",
        "While getting inside the technics of these computational processes can enable us to answer a set of new, interesting questions dealing with semantics, there are many other questions that remain unanswered.\n",

        "For example:\n",
        "* Many language models are built using text from large, online corpora (such as Wikipedia, which is known to have a contributor basis that is majority white, college-educated men) - what kind of impact might this have on a language model?\n",
        "* What barriers to the healthy functioning of democracy are created by the widespread use of these tools and technologies in society?\n",
        "* How might language models challenge or renegotiate ideas around copyright, intellectual property and conceptions of authorship more broadly?\n",
