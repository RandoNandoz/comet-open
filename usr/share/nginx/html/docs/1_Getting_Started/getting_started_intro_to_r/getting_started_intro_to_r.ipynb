        "\n",
        "1.  **Character**: data in text format, like “word” or “abc”\n",

        "    or 18.8 (referred to as **Double** in R)\n",
        "3.  **Integer**: data in a whole number (integer) format, like 2L (the L\n",
        "    tells R to store this as an integer)\n",
        "4.  **Logical**: truth values, like TRUE or FALSE\n",

        "If we are ever wondering what type an object in R is, or what its\n",
